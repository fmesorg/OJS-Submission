As a pioneer and leader in this field, <i>IJME</i> played			the role of fostering commitment to bioethics, mentoring individuals interested in 			specialising in the subject, and, most important, ensuring that institutions were 			sensitised to the need for establishing formal structures for ethical conduct, and 			making them work.  </br></br>						<b>The National Bioethics Conference </b> </br>			With the evolution of the sector, the need emerged for sharing ideas and building a platform 			for different stakeholders to come together and discuss ethical issues in the healthcare field.			There was also a need to promote indigenous, original thinking and experimentation so as to 			develop an ethical framework suitable for the specific contexts in which we work in India.			It was in recognition of this role that <i>IJME</i> needed to play, that the idea of organising National 			Bioethics Conferences was evolved.   </br></br>						The first NBC, on the theme <b>Ethical challenges in healthcare, global context, Indian realities, </b> 			was held at the YMCA International Centre, Mumbai, on November 25-27, 2005. NBC 1 was co-organised 			by 20 institutions. The second NBC was on the theme <b> Moral and ethical imperatives of healthcare 			technologies: scientific, legal and socio-economic perspectives on use and misuse. </b> NBC 2 was held at			the NIMHANS (National Institute for Mental Health and Neurosciences) Convention Centre, Bangalore, 			on December 6-8, 2007. Participation had grown and 38 organisations were involved in the second NBC.</br></br> 						<b>National Bioethics Conference 2010 </b> </br>			<b><i> Governance of healthcare – ethics, equity and justice </i></b> </br>			In recent decades, the Indian health sector has seen revolutionary changes. With the wave of 			globalisation that has hit the country, world class technologies, super-specialities and big 			corporate and private sector hospitals have emerged. However, these are distanced from the 			country’s poor and needy. Globalisation has also paved the way for international collaborations 			in the field of research, service delivery and health education. Although significant achievements 			have been made, there are gaping holes and discrepancies in the public healthcare setup which caters 			to a significant proportion of the population. Keeping these facts in mind, the <b> third NBC,</b> on the 			theme <b> Governance of healthcare: ethics, equity and justice, </b> is being held from November 17 to 20, 2010,			at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, the premier medical institute in the country. </br></br>				<b>NBC 3 </b> aims to bring together diverse perspectives on governance in healthcare, towards building an equitable			and just health system. It will provide a platform for achieving a productive dialogue between practitioners, 			administrators,	policy-makers and activists towards this end. </br></br>						<b>Specific objectives:  </b> </br>			<ul>			<li>To bring together key institutions within the healthcare sector to engage with the issue of governance with a view to ensuring equity and justice for all.  </li>			<li>To enable emerging research in bioethics in India to be presented in a public forum and encouraging this research to be published in national and international journals so that it reaches a wider audience. </li>			<li>To create a forum for organising skill-building and resource sharing in bioethics among different organisations and to enable dialogue between key stakeholders from India and abroad on a range of issues and from a range of perspectives with a view to enlighten healthcare practice, policy making and management from a bioethics perspective.</li>			</ul><br/>
