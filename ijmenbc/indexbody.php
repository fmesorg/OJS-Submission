	Bioethics, which is the title of this national conference, is a term that implies far more 
	than medical ethics which dominates its sessions. What is bioethics? It is no more and no 
	less than the ethics of living or ethics of life, which evolved from non-life over millions 
	of years. Humans are a product of the evolutionary process like all other species, but they 
	are unique insofar as they not only participate in the evolutionary process but also command 
	and determine the future, as brought home so vividly by global warning. Nevertheless, 
	as Professor Hubert Markl remarked, there is a circular relationship between nature and humankind
	 because human concepts are nature's concepts. Human technological and economic inventiveness is 
	 no more than nature's way of acting upon itself and shaping its own future. The outcome could be
	 glorious success or disastrous failure - in either case, nature acting through humankind bears partial
	 responsibility for the outcome. This is fundamentally an ethical question. Are we right, for example, 
	 to cause the profoundest changes in biodiversity in all the 3 billion years of evolution by the mindless
	 destruction of all living species to accommodate 10 billion human beings and their domesticated slave 
	 species of animals and plants? To make a sustainable future, we have an obligation to act in accordance
	 with the dictates of reason and moral norms, and remain responsible for what we do. It is this undoubted
	 fact of nature that makes us look for guidance to bioethics, without which life would be replaced by fossils.
	 I would, therefore, compliment the organisers for placing the deliberations of this conference against the 
	 austere background of bioethics.

<font face="arial" size="2">
	It was towards the end of the last century that medical ethics assumed the character of a distinct discipline
	in India, attracting the attention of professionals from both law and medicine. However, bioethics was not 
	a major issue in professional discourse at that time. The focus was more on technological applications in 
	medicine and healthcare, and their human rights implications. The concern was on medical negligence and the
	need for consumer protection.

<font face="arial" size="2">
	The recently concluded Indian Journal of Medical Ethics Second National Bioethics Conference brought together
	over 500 delegates, speakers and other participants from a wide range of disciplines. The participants were 
	a blend of healthcare professionals, academicians, researchers, media professionals and, interestingly, many
	retired professionals and laypersons. Though doctors and researchers represented the majority, the blend 
	clearly reflected the growing interest in bioethics amongst people of all walks of life and an increase in 
	the strength and momentum of the bioethics movement in India.

<font face="arial" size="2">
	I want to thank the organisers of the Second National Bioethics Conference (NBC 2007) for putting together 
	an exceptional conference. I had an opportunity to also attend the first conference in Mumbai which I thought
	was an first-rate production but you outdid yourself with this year's effort. The theme--ethics and 
	biotechnology--was particularly appropriate. The plenary sessions were excellent and the level of discussion
	has surely gone up a notch or two. The joint sessions that I attended were all very good (I wish that I could
	have attended them all) and the movies added yet another important dimension. There's no doubt in my mind that
	the two conferences have done much to raise the level of awareness and dialogue on so many important issues 
	in biomedical ethics. I was particularly pleased to see so many college and university students in attendance.
	These conferences were so important to further interest and dialogue in this critical area and I would urge you 
	to continue this important work with future conferences.

<font face="arial" size="2">
	The First National Bioethics Conference, November 25-27, 2005 (NBC, 2005), organised by the Indian Journal
	of Medical Ethics (IJME), brought together a diverse group of organisations and individuals in an effort
	to give a platform for bioethics discourse from across the country. The conference was organised around
	four issues: ethical challenges in HIV/AIDS; ethics of life and death in the era of high-tech health care;
	ethical responsibilities in violence, conflict and religious strife; and ethics and equity in clinical trials.
	Three cross-cutting themes that emerged during discussions were ethical challenges in biomedical and social 
	science research, ethical responsibilities of clinical care providers, and the intersections of bioethics 
	and public health/clinical medicine.
