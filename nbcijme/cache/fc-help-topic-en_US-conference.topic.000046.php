		<p><em>Peer Review:</em><br /> Review guidelines are specified here, and are made available to Reviewers when they enter the review process. Additionally, the Conference Manager can specify how the Reviewer interacts with the submission files, how much time they have to access the files, and how often they are reminded of the review if it hasn\'t been completed. There is also an option to allow Directors to rate Reviewers on a five-point scale. </p>
