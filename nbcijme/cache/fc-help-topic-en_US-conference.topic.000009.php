		<p>The Reading Tools engage readers in many aspects: they not only enable the readers to access the abstract and supplementary files of conference presentations, but can also provide bibliographical detail, indexing metadata, and printer-friendly versions; they allow users to quickly look up word definitions online by double-clicking a word in a presentation; they search relevant subject databases for references and citations linked to the presentation; provide author biography and contact information; and provide the option for emailing the article to a contact, or commenting on the presentation itself.</p>
		<p>Once activated, the Reading Tools will appear in a frame beside all published items that have been designated for indexing. The Conference Manager is able to edit or delete existing Reading Tools resources and add new ones as well. See {help_topic key="user.readingTools" text="Reading Tools"} under Conference Web Site.</p>',
