        'content' => '<p><strong>Background and vision </strong><br /><br /> Healthcare in India has become increasingly polarized between a high cost sophisticated private sector and poorly equipped and administered public health facilities. Add to this the burgeoning outsourcing to the country of health-related research, mainly in drugs, to which our treatment na&iuml;ve population, especially the poorest sections, is exposed, and the need to organize an informed and committed has become very urgent.<br /><br /> <em>IJME</em> is a peer reviewed indexed journal which has completed 20 years of uninterrupted publication. Since 1993, it has acted as a forum for all those struggling to establish medical ethics and bioethics in the country. Known first as <em>Medical Ethics</em> and then as <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em>, it has promoted scientific exchange and debates on bioethics in India. A pioneer and leader in this field within low and middle income countries; it has fostered a commitment to bioethics while also encouraging scholarship in the field. Most importantly, it has been facilitating awareness building and sensitization of institutions to the ethical dimensions of their work and the role they can play in improving the ethical and regulatory standards of health research and healthcare delivery.</p>
<p><strong>The National Bioethics Conference</strong><br /><br /> With the evolution of bioethics in the country, a need was felt to share ideas and experiences on ethical issues arising in the areas of health systems and health research. There was a strongly felt need to promote original thinking and to develop an ethical framework suitable for the Indian context. It was in recognition of this need that IJME decided to create the platform of the National Bioethics Conferences (NBC).&nbsp; The NBC is a platform bringing together clinicians, scholars, health researchers, students, researchers and all who wish to build an equitable and efficient healthcare system, accessible to the poor and needy. It was first organized in 2005 under the banner of the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics (IJME</em>) and went from strength to strength in 2007 and 2010.<br /><br /> The first NBC was on the theme &lsquo;Ethical challenges in health, global context, Indian realities&rsquo;, held at the YMCA International Centre, Mumbai from November 25 to 27, 2005. It was organized jointly with 20 institutions. The second NBC, organized in 2007, was on the theme &lsquo;Moral and ethical imperatives of healthcare technologies: scientific, legal and socio-economic perspectives&rsquo; and was held at the NIMHANS (National Institute for Mental Health and Neurosciences) Convention Centre, Bangalore from December 6 to 8, 2007. Participation grew, and 38 organisations were involved in the second NBC. The third NBC, co-organised by 38 organisations from all over India, was on the theme of &ldquo;Governance of health care: ethics, equity and justice.&rdquo; It was held from November18 to 20, 2010 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, the premier medical institute in the country.</p>
<p><strong>The Fourth National Bioethics Conference </strong><br /> <strong>Theme: Ethical and regulatory challenges in health research</strong><br /><br /> To be held in Hyderabad, it has for its theme &ldquo;Ethical and regulatory challenges in health research&rdquo;. India is a key centre for health research in various disciplines ranging from biomedical to social sciences. The growing amount of research has been supported by an increasing number of training courses and of organisations which conduct research. This is an opportune time to study this phenomenon, with a focus on the ethics and regulatory challenges involved. We present in the following sub-section some of the key reasons why we believe the theme is apt.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br /><br /> That health research is essential for better health has been emphasized in the World Health Report for 2012 with the theme &ldquo;No health without health research&rdquo;. The Department of Health Research, India will complete five years since its establishment on October 5, 2007. This marks an important period for the emphasis on public healthcare research in India and its growth. A recent report by the Working Group on Health Research for the 12<sup>th</sup> Plan (2012 &ndash; 2017) has declared that &ldquo;research to be undertaken should be on country specific health problems essential for the formulation of sound policies and plans for field action.<br /><br /> And further that this is &ldquo;possible only when there is well defined funding, infrastructure and priority for health research.&rdquo; It has also recognised &ldquo;the need to appreciate and respond to ethical issues in medical and health research.&rdquo; The general concern in civil society about ethical and regulatory standards in healthcare and health research is also reflected in the National Consultation on Regulation of Drug Trials in India on Sept 26-27, 2011 (Sama, 2012).<br /><br /> Against this backdrop the forth <strong>NBC </strong>on the theme<strong> </strong>Ethical and regulatory challenges in health research is being held from <strong>December 6 to 8, 2012</strong> at the <strong>University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad</strong>. This conference would bring together key stakeholders to examine the theme, and would be also a gesture of tribute to IJME on its entering into 20th year of publication.<br /><br /> <strong>NBC-4 Goal: </strong>To bring together different key constituencies/stakeholders for sharing their diverse perspectives on the conference theme &ndash; Ethical and regulatory challenges in health research- with an aim towards building a better research enterprise and an environment that enables conducting ethical health research.</p>
<ul>
<strong>Specific objectives</strong>:<br /><br />
<li>To enable dialogue between varied constituencies relating to bioethics health research regulatory apparatuses other relevant from India and abroad on a range of ethical standards and regulatory related challenges towards improving health research as a whole.</li>
<li>To offer a public platform for presenting emerging research in bioethics in India and outside; and encouraging individuals and      institutions to publish these emerging scholarship in national and international journals.</li>
<li>To create a forum via workshops and symposia that will be organized at the forth NBC for skill-building and resource sharing in bioethics among different organisations and constituencies.</li>
<li>To initiate focused discussions about the need for, functions of, and potential organizational structures of a body such as Indian Bioethics Society or Association, building on the unique organizing structure of the NBC bringing together collaborating partners.</li>
