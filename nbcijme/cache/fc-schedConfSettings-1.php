<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>About the National Bioethics Conference</strong></span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: small;">The evolution of bioethics in the country created an urgent need to promote original thinking and to develop an ethical framework the field of health and in related areas that impact health, It was in recognition of this need that the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> (<em>IJME)</em> organised the platform of the National Bioethics Conference (NBC). The NBC seeks to bring together clinicians, scholars, advocacy groups, policy makers, health researchers, students, and all who wish to build an equitable and efficient healthcare system, accessible to all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Background and vision</strong></span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: small;"><em>IJME</em> is an indexed peer-reviewed journal and a pioneer and leader in this field within low and middle income countries. Over 20 years of its existence, it has fostered a commitment to bioethics, and contributed to scholarship in the field. &nbsp;Most importantly, it has been facilitating opportunities for awareness building and sensitisation. The NBC has been an effort in this direction. It was first organised in 2005 under the banner of <em>IJME,</em> and then in 2007 and 2010, on themes related to ethical challenges in the Indian context; the ethical imperatives thrown up by developing healthcare technologies; and the governance of healthcare.

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The Fourth National Bioethics Conference </strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>Ethical and regulatory challenges in health research</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: small;">The Fourth National Bioethics Conference has for its theme &ldquo;Ethical and regulatory challenges in health research&rdquo;. India is a key centre for health research in various disciplines ranging from biomedical to social sciences. The last 15 years have seen a major shift in clinical trial sites from North America to India and other low and middle income countries. Clinical research organisations (CROs) are playing a key role in facilitating this outsourcing of drug research. The growing amount of research has been supported by an increasing number of training courses and of organisations which conduct research. This is an opportune time to study this phenomenon, with a focus on the ethical and regulatory challenges involved.</span><!--<br--><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The importance of health research has been emphasised in the World Health Report for 2012 with the theme &ldquo;No health without health research&rdquo;. This year the Department of Health Research, government of India, will complete five years since its establishment on October 5, 2007. This marks an important period for the development of public healthcare research in India. The general concern in civil society about ethical and regulatory standards in healthcare and health research is also reflected in the National Consultation on Regulation of Drug Trials in India on September 26-27, 2011.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Against this backdrop the NBC 4 is being held from December 6 to 8, 2012 at the University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad. This conference will bring together concerned groups and individuals to examine the theme, share their diverse viewpoints, and strive to build a better research enterprise and an environment which facilitates ethical health research</span></p>
