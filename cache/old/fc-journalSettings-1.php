No: F-17441 Mumbai, 1995), in India. It is also registered under the Income Tax Act, 1961: Section 12A (Reg. No- TR/31522-1995); Section 80G (Order No- DIT(E)/MC/80G/172/2010-11).</p><p>The members of the FMES are professionals and activists from various disciplines from different parts of the country. It is governed by the General Body of its members, and the Managing Committee and Office Bearers elected in the General Body meetings. The membership of the FMES is on invitation.</p><p><strong>History and Activities of the FMES</strong></p><p>The Forum for Medical Ethics Society (FMES) emerged from a unique combination of activism and education/sensitization at the interface of the healthcare system and society’s needs; drawing   concerned professionals from healthcare and related fields such as the social sciences, humanities, law etc, as well as activists from civil society to work together.</p><p>Although the formal organisation was registered in 1995, its work began in 1989, when a group of concerned activists and health professionals started meeting infrequently in the office of the neurosurgery department of the KEM hospital, Mumbai, to discuss ethical challenges in healthcare. The issues that exercised the group were the gross erosion of medical ethics and patients’ rights, dysfunctional medical councils, inequities in access to health care and the decline in the public health system. From 1991 to 1999, weekly meetings were regularly organised at the KEM hospital, the group conducted regular monthly open group discussions (they were called study circles) and interacted with associations of healthcare professions and with the voluntary groups such as Medico Friend Circle, health research NGOs and consumer groups. At the same time, the group also made efforts to intervene (e.g. contesting elections of Maharashtra Medical Council) and provide support to campaigns aimed at improving ethical standards and for universal access to health care.</p><p>Over the years, three groups of activities have emerged as the main work of the FMES:</p><p>(a) Publication of the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em>, as a broad healthcare ethics journal for the developing world, giving space to essays that critique and provide alternatives for reforms, and at the same time, publish the empirical and theoretical research that advances the field of bioethics in India;</p><p>(b) Organisation of the National Bioethics Conferences (NBCs): In order to bring together healthcare and other professionals as well as health activists on one platform to share their work and debate, the FMES organised the first NBC on the platform of the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> in Mumbai, in 2005. Since then, the NBC has been organised every two or three years, with four NBCs (2005, 2007, 2010, 2012) being organised so far.</p><p>(c) The members of the FMES, individually, in small groups or as a part of the institutions they work with, make efforts to promote research and training in healthcare ethics, and whenever possible, provide assistance and consultation on bioethics.</p>',

    'en_US' => '<p>In 1992, eight doctors known for their eminence in ethical practice and concern for the public health system established a panel on the platform of Forum for Medical Ethics (FME) and contested the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) elections. By sending out a letter to all doctors in Maharashtra and by using the media for creating public awareness on the role and responsibilities of the Medical Councils, the FME strove to bring the implementation of medical ethics to the centre of the debate in the election. The FME ensured that votes for the members of its panel were voluntarily sent through mail by each voter on his/her own in the postal ballot system used for the elections at that time. The group also witnessed massive rigging of the elections by the candidate-doctors supported by money power and politics. The electoral malpractices were documented in detail by the group, and presented to the Mumbai High Court in a PIL and also communicated widely through the first newsletter, entitled “Medical Ethics”, published in August 1993.</p><p><em>Medical Ethics </em>found wider support from the profession and the public, and was brought out every three months and gradually expanded its scope. When it applied for registration as a journal with the Registrar of Newspapers, New Delhi, it was provided a new title, and so from January 1996, it was brought out as <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em>. Later, when the Registrar of Newspapers accepted our application for the change in name, the journal started coming out as <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> from January 2004.</p><p>Since its inception in 1993, the following have served with dedication as the editors of the journal:</p><ul><li>Sunil K.

    'en_US' => '<p><em>The Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> aims to encourage discussion on healthcare ethics from the perspective of the developing world. The journal’s guidelines for authors are based on the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (<a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="new">www.icmje.org</a>)<strong>.</strong> ICMJE has recently added a fourth criterion for authorship, namely: "Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved". Authors are advised to consult the guideline, available from: http://www.icmje.org/new_recommendations.html).</p><p><strong>General principles</strong></p><p>We welcome <strong>original</strong> submissions that examine issues of health care ethics in India and other developing countries. We are interested in articles based on substantial work that contribute new data and insights to existing discussions; as well as those that identify new areas for work.</p><p><strong>Reviewers of submissions to <em>IJME</em> are asked to consider questions such as: Does the article address issues relevant to bioethics in developing countries? Is the information topical? Is it new? What type of influence would it have?</strong> <strong>Is the interpretation warranted? Does it make loose generalisations? Are there any major omissions? </strong></p><p><strong>Contributors are expected to understand the principles of publication ethics </strong>and<strong> </strong>abstain from  redundant, duplicate or “salami” publication, gift authorship and other unethical practices<strong>.</strong> We will not tolerate plagiarism and will take action on any evidence of plagiarism in a submission.</p><p>Articles reporting on research should include information on ethics review: the organisation that reviewed the research, and its suggestions or instructions to the researchers. Discussions on sensitive medical or social issues should not contain any information that might identify the individuals or groups involved.</p><p><em>IJME </em>will publish anonymous submissions under very specific circumstances: the article must make an important point about a problem in health care, it must not identify any particular person, and the person making the anonymous submission must reveal his/her identity to the editor.</p><p><strong>Submission categories</strong></p><p>Submissions are welcome on ethical aspects of clinical practice, research and health policy that are relevant to developing countries. We are particularly interested in articles that use concepts in bioethics to analyse these issues.</p><p>Articles on ethics review and on the link between law and ethics will be considered for the “ethics of ethics committees” and “ethics and the law” sections respectively.</p><p>Commentaries on articles related to healthcare ethics will be considered for the “selected summary” section.</p><p>Personal accounts in research, clinical practice and public health are invited<strong> </strong>for submission as case studies that may be carried with a commentary<strong>. </strong></p><p>Students<strong> </strong>may contribute interesting experiences and reflections to the section “medical students speak”.<strong> </strong></p><p><em>IJME</em> will consider reviews of books, films and other media that have appeared within the preceding calendar year.</p><p>Well-written and thoughtful personal anecdotes that have a bearing on healthcare ethics may be considered for publication as comments. Summaries from the press and from journals are also welcome.</p><p>Responses to published articles can help promote further debate on the issues discussed in the journal. Substantial responses will be considered for publication as comments. Shorter letters will be considered for the correspondence section.</p><p>Editorials are written by members of the editorial board or commissioned, as are case study responses.</p><p><strong>Word count</strong></p><p><em>IJME</em> does not have word count restrictions for submissions, with the caveat that the journal considers clarity in writing to be vital. However, submissions to the reviews section and correspondence are generally limited to 850 words.</p><p><strong>Style<em> </em></strong><em></em></p><p><em>IJME’s </em>readership includes people from different academic and work backgrounds. Please write in a clear and direct style. Write in the active voice, avoid long sentences, make minimum use of abbreviations, and spell out acronyms the first time they are used. Please keep the title short, simple and relevant and use subheads to break up the text in long articles. Please follow our guidelines for references.</p><p>Please seek the assistance of a writer if necessary, giving appropriate acknowledgment to the writer in the article.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Please limit the references to those essential to justify the point being made, and to <strong>authoritative</strong> sources. References should be complete, with details of the author/s, title, publication title, publishers, place and date of publication. An additional Internet link to the publication being cited is also welcome.</p><p>Please get <strong>permission</strong> from the source <strong>to cite personal communications</strong>, and include them in brackets in the text, with details of the date if possible.</p><p><strong>References must be verified</strong> against the original documents before submitting the article. The author is responsible for the accuracy of the references. Please recheck Internet-based references when finalising the submission; if the link is no longer functional, please search for an equivalent reference rather than cite an inactive reference.</p><p><strong>References should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they appear in the text</strong>. They should appear within parentheses in the text, and not in superscript, with the full list of references listed at the end of the article. The journal follows the ICMJE’s Uniform Requirements for references. General rules for this may be found at <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html">www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html</a> with details in the book <em>Citing Medicine </em>available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/</p><p>Papers with <strong>incomplete references</strong> are likely to be returned to the authors for correction before being sent for review. Authors of <strong>accepted </strong>manuscripts will be expected to <strong>format references</strong> in the IJME format.</p><div><p><strong>Tables and figures </strong>which enhance understanding of a paper are welcome.</p></div>',
