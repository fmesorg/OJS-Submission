It is governed by the General Body of its members, and the Managing Committee and Office Bearers elected in the General Body meetings. The membership of the FMES is on invitation.</p><p><strong>History and Activities of the FMES</strong></p><p>The Forum for Medical Ethics Society (FMES) emerged from a unique combination of activism and education/sensitization at the interface of the healthcare system and society’s needs; drawing   concerned professionals from healthcare and related fields such as the social sciences, humanities, law etc, as well as activists from civil society to work together.</p><p>Although the formal organisation was registered in 1995, its work began in 1989, when a group of concerned activists and health professionals started meeting infrequently in the office of the neurosurgery department of the KEM hospital, Mumbai, to discuss ethical challenges in healthcare. The issues that exercised the group were the gross erosion of medical ethics and patients’ rights, dysfunctional medical councils, inequities in access to health care and the decline in the public health system. From 1991 to 1999, weekly meetings were regularly organised at the KEM hospital, the group conducted regular monthly open group discussions (they were called study circles) and interacted with associations of healthcare professions and with the voluntary groups such as Medico Friend Circle, health research NGOs and consumer groups. At the same time, the group also made efforts to intervene (e.g. contesting elections of Maharashtra Medical Council) and provide support to campaigns aimed at improving ethical standards and for universal access to health care.</p><p>Over the years, three groups of activities have emerged as the main work of the FMES:</p><p>(a) Publication of the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em>, as a broad healthcare ethics journal for the developing world, giving space to essays that critique and provide alternatives for reforms, and at the same time, publish the empirical and theoretical research that advances the field of bioethics in India;</p><p>(b) Organisation of the National Bioethics Conferences (NBCs): In order to bring together healthcare and other professionals as well as health activists on one platform to share their work and debate, the FMES organised the first NBC on the platform of the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> in Mumbai, in 2005. Since then, the NBC has been organised every two or three years, with four NBCs (2005, 2007, 2010, 2012) being organised so far.</p><p>(c) The members of the FMES, individually, in small groups or as a part of the institutions they work with, make efforts to promote research and training in healthcare ethics, and whenever possible, provide assistance and consultation on bioethics.</p>',

    'en_US' => '<p>In 1992, eight doctors known for their eminence in ethical practice and concern for the public health system established a panel on the platform of Forum for Medical Ethics (FME) and contested the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) elections. By sending out a letter to all doctors in Maharashtra and by using the media for creating public awareness on the role and responsibilities of the Medical Councils, the FME strove to bring the implementation of medical ethics to the centre of the debate in the election. The FME ensured that votes for the members of its panel were voluntarily sent through mail by each voter on his/her own in the postal ballot system used for the elections at that time. The group also witnessed massive rigging of the elections by the candidate-doctors supported by money power and politics. The electoral malpractices were documented in detail by the group, and presented to the Mumbai High Court in a PIL and also communicated widely through the first newsletter, entitled “Medical Ethics”, published in August 1993.</p><p><em>Medical Ethics </em>found wider support from the profession and the public, and was brought out every three months and gradually expanded its scope. When it applied for registration as a journal with the Registrar of Newspapers, New Delhi, it was provided a new title, and so from January 1996, it was brought out as <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em>. Later, when the Registrar of Newspapers accepted our application for the change in name, the journal started coming out as <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> from January 2004.</p><p>Since its inception in 1993, the following have served with dedication as the editors of the journal:</p><ul><li>Sunil K.
