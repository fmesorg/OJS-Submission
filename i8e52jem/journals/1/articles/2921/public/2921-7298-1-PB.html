                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>The ouster of Professor Peter Gotzsche who headed the Nordic Cochrane Centre, from Cochrane, a respected international research organisation, has provoked a crisis of confidence in the organisation's future. Disputant and bystander reactions on this issue are presented, as well as concerns regarding conflicts of interest and the reliability of Cochrane reviews. Cochrane's crisis mirrors the larger crisis of confidence that pervades the entire enterprise of medical research.</p>
                <p>We note that within weeks after Gotzsche was expelled from Cochrane, the HPV vaccine (whose Cochrane review he had publicly criticised for conflicts of interest and poor science) received a license expansion in the United States that might be worth billions of dollars to the manufacturer.</p>
                <p>Finally, we suggest a variety of new approaches that could strengthen the value of Cochrane analyses, broaden Cochrane's approach to include additional methodologies, and enhance its independence from financial interests.</p>

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>On July 27, 2018, <em>BMJ's Evidence Based Medicine</em> published an article by Jorgensen, Gotzsche, and Jefferson (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jorgensen L, Gotzsche PC, Jefferson T.

In effect, the HPV vaccine review authors were accused of cherry-picking the data in support of conclusions that were incongruent with the totality of the literature.</p>
                <p>On September 17, 2018, the Cochrane Governing Board announced its intention to discipline Peter Gotzsche, a Cochrane founder and member of the Governing Board, for "bad behaviour" (<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Statement made by the Governing Board at Cochrane's 2018 Annual General Meeting, 17th September, at the Edinburgh Cochran Colloquium. [cited 2018 Nov 7]. Available from: https://www.cochrane.org/news/statement-cochranes-governing-board." id="3">3</a>). Gotzsche's role as an intrepid critic of corruption in medicine provides context for this decision. First, Gotzsche wrote the provocative book <em>Deadly medicines and organised crime: How Big Pharma has corrupted health care,</em> published in 2013. Second, Gotzsche and Jorgensen (<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cochrane Nordic. Complaint to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) over maladministration at the EMA. 2016 May 26 [cited 2018 Nov 7]. Available from: http://nordic.cochrane.org/sites/nordic.cochrane.org/files/public/uploads/ResearchHighlights/Complaint-to-EMA-over-EMA.pdf" id="4">4</a>) had challenged in 2016 the validity of the European Medicines Agency assessment of HPV vaccine safety, highlighting questionable procedural issues, conflicts of interest, and the imposition of lifelong confidentiality agreements.</p>
                <p>On September 26, 2018, the Cochrane Governing Board made known its vote from the day before to terminate Professor Gotzsche's membership and positions in the organisation (<a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Statement from Cochrane's Governing Board &ndash; 26th September 2018 [cited 2018 Sep 30]. Available from: https://www.cochrane.org/news/statement-cochranes-governing-board-26th-september-2018" id="5">5</a>). Revelations by the disputants and bystander reactions to his ouster have shaken confidence in Cochrane, both as a reliable source of integrative research reviews and as an organisation free of conflicts of interest.</p>
                <p>The controversy revealed that the conflicts of interest, together with the lack of verifiability of clinical trial data in general that underpins Cochrane's published meta-analyses, are formidable impediments to the production of reliable research reviews. Yet, there is a dire need for accurate evaluations of drugs, vaccines and medical devices culled from the jungle of published and unpublished biomedical data.</p>
                <p>Our frame of reference in assessing the gush of disputant and bystander reactions is the same analytical model demonstrated in Stegenga's <em>Medical Nihilism</em> (<a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Stegenga J. Medical Nihilism. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2018. 256 pp." id="6">6</a>)&mdash;an empirically-grounded, logical demonstration of the essential malleability of all medical research. This includes, in particular, the randomised controlled trial (RCT), whose method is sometimes claimed as the "gold standard" to guide medical decision-making and policy.</p>

                <h4>Reactions and concerns for the future</h4>
                <p>Reactions to the Cochrane Governing Board's statement came fast and furious both from within the organisation and from without. Four of the 12 Governing Board members resigned in protest over Gotzsche's expulsion from Cochrane, and wrote a letter of explanation, concluding:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>It is our hope and deepest desire that this event will encourage all Cochrane members and the wider community to reflect upon where we currently find ourselves and give serious consideration to what we want for the future of Cochrane and its principles, objectives, and ethos.

                </blockquote>
                <p>The reactions were mostly critical of the Governing Board's decision. They can be sorted into four categories: (a) arguments about "who did what to whom and the wherefores and whys" (<a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime blogsite (30 September 2018).

                <h4>Bystander analyses</h4>
                <p>One bystander, Nass (<a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nass M (18 September 2018). E-mail re: Cochrane Board &quot;Explanation&quot; to Vera H Sharav, cc: Mary Holland, John H Noble Jr." id="19">19</a>), summarised the situation with respect to how the pharmaceutical industry (Pharma) might benefit from Cochrane's crisis. She further noted that, in the US, a deliberately misleading literature review could subject the authors to a legal charge of scientific misconduct by falsification (<a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (25 August 2010). Research Integrity. 2010 Aug 25 [cited 2018 Oct 7]. Available from: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/research_integrity/research_misconduct.htm" id="20">20</a>). Her analysis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the Cochrane HPV review stands, it props the door open for Pharma's continuing capture of Cochrane's work and reputation.</li>
                    <li>For Pharma, if Cochrane is captured, it's a big win.</li>
                    <li>For Pharma, if the (sometimes pesky) Cochrane is not captured, but instead self-destructs, that too is a big win.</li>
                    <li>For Pharma, the only loss would be if Cochrane tightens its belt and its standards, refuses Pharma-laundered funds and refuses to use authors with financial conflicts of interest.</li>
                    <li>Right now, this looks like a position that is unlikely to result, but appears to be the only option to preserve Cochrane as we knew it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>David Healy puts in perspective Cochrane's longstanding commitment to systematically gathering all RCTs on treatment, winnowing out duplicate reports, and seeking to identify unpublished trials (<a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Healy D. Cochrane cock-up. Davidhealy.org. 2018 Sep 17 [cited 2018 Sep 30]. Available from: https://davidhealy.org/cochrane-cock-up/" id="11">11</a>)&mdash;a good idea, but insufficient to overcome the known problems in the conduct and reporting of RCTs. Healy argues, "If RCTs don't consistently give the same effectiveness result they are irredeemably flawed." (<a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Healy D. Data Based Medicine. Davidhealy.org. 2018 Sep 20 [cited 2018 Sep 30], Available from: https://davidhealy.org/data-based-medicine-and-cochrane-inc/" id="12">12</a>, <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Healy D. The valley of death. Davidhealy.org. 2018 Sep 25 [cited 2018 Sep 30]. Available from: https://davidhealy.org/the-valley-of-death/" id="13">13</a>) In an earlier blog, Healy (<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Healy D. The empire of humbug: Not so bad Pharma. Davidhealy.org. 2013 Apr 23 [cited 2018 Sep 30]. Available from: https://davidhealy.org/the-empire-of-humbug-not-so-bad-pharma/" id="14">14</a>) argued that RCTs are "gold standard processors into which we have fed garbage and have got garbage back."</p>
                <p>There is vast literature documenting the influence of corrupt medical research practices, such as concealing adverse events and negative data, penning names to ghost-written publications, publishing biased promotional reports, and hoodwinking the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by false reporting of efficacy and safety (<a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ioannidis JPA.

                <p>The real issue is that there are numerous threats to reliability and validity at each of the major stages in the performance of a research review, including at least: (a) problem formulation, (b) identification of relevant studies, (c) judging research quality and controlling researcher and reviewer bias, (d) analysis and interpretation, (e) public presentation and (f) interpreting effect size (<a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cooper HM.

                <p>Moreover, the FDA expanded Gardasil's market <em>in the absence of data support</em> for either efficacy or safety in the expanded age group.</p>

                    <li>FDA ignored evidence of increased deaths in women over 25 who had received Gardasil (<a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Arbyn, Xu L.

                    <li>In its approval document expanding Gardasil's age range, FDA made the outrageous claim that "Solicited AEs (adverse events) were not collected due to the extensive safety database of GARDASIL in younger age groups" (<a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="US Food and Drug Administration.

                </ul>
                <p>FDA's approval was based on sleight of hand, using specious arguments to draw the following conclusions: that injection site reactions were more "substantial" than systemic reactions (or deaths) and, since HPV infection can cause serious disease (despite lack of evidence that HPV vaccine prevents cancers rather than precancerous lesions that may spontaneously normalise), therefore the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks in adults aged 26-45. According to the approval document:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Given that the most substantial risks of vaccination with GARDASIL 9 are injection site reactions that are self-limited and mild in severity, the potential benefits of the vaccine, which can prevent serious and/or life-threatening disease, outweigh the potential risks. Therefore, the overall benefit-risk assessment is favorable for use of GARDASIL 9 in adults 27 through 45 years of age.

                </blockquote>
                <p>Had the Cochrane HPV review authors&mdash;several of whom had financial conflicts of interest&mdash;written a more critical review, or had the Cochrane leaders not officially disputed Jorgensen, Gotzsche and Jefferson's critique of the Cochrane HPV review, might FDA's approval of Gardasil's license expansion have been impeded?</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h4>Whither Cochrane?</h4>
                <p>What can Cochrane do to survive its crisis? We offer suggestions based on disputant and bystander reactions, given increasing revelations of how medical industries have found ways to taint every aspect of the medical research endeavour.</p>
                <h5>Conflicts of interest</h5>
                <p>Cochrane must address and fix its conflicts of interest in securing adequate financing from industry and philanthropic and governmental agencies (<a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Godlee F. Reinvigorating Cochrane. BMJ. 2018 Sep 20 [cited 2018 Sep 30];362:k3966. Available from: https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3966.full" id="17">17</a>). Godlee's question, "How close to industry is too close?" needs a clear answer now.</p>
                <p>Ideally, funding can be found without strings attached, but the harsh reality is, "Whose bread I eat, his song I sing" (German proverb). The Cochrane faces moral hazard and fierce competition in pursuit of adequate sustainable funding with high risk for co-optation and goal displacement regardless of funding source (<a class="reference" href="#twentynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Froelich KA. Diversification of revenue strategies: evolving resource dependence in nonprofit organizations. Nonprofit Volunt Sect Q. 1999; 28(3): 246-68." id="29">29</a>). Government funding, which provided a great deal of support to Cochrane, may pose as potent a threat to bias-free independence as industry support, and guidelines for government support need to be as transparent as those for industry.</p>
                <h5>Advocacy for truth in labelling</h5>
                <p>Cochrane might reinvent itself as a proactive advocate and lobbyist for truthful and comprehensive reporting of the effectiveness and harms of drugs, vaccines, and medical devices. All data, not only that derived from RCTs, need to be evaluated: clinical study reports, raw trial data, regulatory agency reports on how trials are conducted, evidence from litigation and enforcement agencies, as well as the professional and legal reputations of those engaged in conducting clinical trials. The FDA has in the past licensed drugs using clinical trial data obtained by clinicians who fabricated data&mdash;despite several going to prison for doing so (<a class="reference" href="#thirty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharav VH. Scientific fraud: Eric Poehlman/Richard Borison. Alliance for Human Research Protection. 2006 Oct 29 [cited 2018 Oct 7]. Available from: http://ahrp.org/scientific-fraud-eric-poehlman-richard-borison/" id="30">30</a>). The use of disreputable data to determine the proper use of therapeutics can never be acceptable&mdash;no matter if it is by Pharma, the FDA, the CDC, European regulators, or Cochrane. Labels describing the proper use of therapeutics must be accurate and comprehensive. Cochrane should exhort agencies such as the FDA, CDC and EMA to use only verifiably accurate data and research methods that do not "spin" data.</p>
                <h5>Appropriate analytic methods</h5>
                <p>There is also the matter of using appropriate statistical methods to calculate confidence intervals, perform null hypothesis significance tests, derive p-values, and calculate effect sizes (<a class="reference" href="#thirtyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cumming G. The New Statistics: Estimation and research integrity. Parts 1-5. Association for Psychological Science. Date unknown [cited 2018 Oct 7]. Available from: https://www.psychologicalscience.org/members/new-statistics" id="31">31</a>). RCT requirements for drug approval do not adequately account for verified prior knowledge&mdash;underscoring why so many RCT results are wrong, misleading, and a waste of money (<a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ioannidis JPA. Why most published research findings are false. PLOS Medicine. 2005 Aug 30 [cited 2018 Oct 7].

                <p>There is need to end the common practices of: (a) comparing a new drug to an inert placebo (or anything less than the current best treatment for efficacy assessment) (b) using subjects in clinical trials who are less likely to show adverse reactions than the population who will receive it (<a class="reference" href="#thirtytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Doshi P.

Available from: https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k4152" id="33">33</a>); and (c) using active, adverse effect-inducing "placebos" (usually novel adjuvants or other vaccines) in vaccine trials, obscuring adverse events caused by the vaccine being tested.</p>
                <h5>Advocacy for full transparency</h5>
                <p>Cochrane might reinvent itself as an advocate for full disclosure and sharing among researchers of verifiable data. The goal would be to: (a) promote truth in research reporting (<a class="reference" href="#thirtyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Carroll BJ, Noble JH Jr, Nardo JM (2016).

Available from: https://www.change.org/p/congress-congress-stop-false-reporting-of-drug-benefits-harms-by-making-fda-nih-work-together" id="34">34</a>), (b) minimise opportunities for researcher manipulation of data and statistical analysis to produce biased conclusions, and thus (c) reduce the threats to reproducible science that "...undermine the robustness of published research, and may also impact on the ability of science to self-correct." (<a class="reference" href="#thirtyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Munafo MR, Nosek BA, Bishop, DVM, et al. A manifesto for reproducible science.

                <h5>Reinvention as trusted conduit for verified data sharing</h5>
                <p>More ambitiously, Cochrane might reinvent itself as an independent recipient of verified RCT information via block-chain smart contracting (<a class="reference" href="#thirtyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nugent T, Upton D, Cimpoesu M. Improving data transparency in clinical trials using blockchain smart contracts [version 1; referees: 3 approved]. F1000 Res. 2016 Oct 20; 5: 2541.

This method permits researchers to transmit to an independent party (such as Cochrane) information about research hypotheses and the details of design and implementation, including data inputs on individual, anonymised RCT subjects. This method enables the identification of changes to data or analytic methods at any step of a trial. The Yale University YODA project (<a class="reference" href="#thirtynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project. Date unknown [cited 2018 Oct 29]. Available from: http://yoda.yale.edu/" id="39">39</a>) provides a template of conditions for allowing researchers, physicians and others who seek access to use clinical trial data.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Cochrane's reputation for excellence in producing unbiased literature reviews has been seriously tarnished. New scrutiny of the premises underlying the conduct of meta-analyses add to the jeopardy it faces. The likelihood of takeover by industry or government financial largesse, if it has not happened already, seems greater than ever.</p>
                <p>Will Cochrane recommit itself to seeking the strongest evidence available to assess therapies, recommit to transparent research methods and governance, and consider flexible research approaches as the problems with individual research methods are identified and understood? Can Cochrane seize this moment to disentangle the processes of medical research from those who have the most to gain by tainting them? Is Cochrane up to the challenge?</p>
