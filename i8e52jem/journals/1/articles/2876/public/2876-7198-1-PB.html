                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>The Medical Council of India (MCI)'s recent guidelines on admission of persons with specified disabilities into the medical course under the disability quota has escalated into a huge controversy. Multiple litigations have been initiated against MCI by successful National Eligibility cum Entrance Test candidates with disabilities across the country. In light of our new Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, I argue in this essay that these guidelines are unfair, discriminatory and unlawful. I quote Supreme Court judgments on reasonable accommodation, equality and discrimination and highlight the exclusion of doctors with disabilities in policy making.</p>

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>India ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in 2007, which made it mandatory to harmonise all its existing legislations in line with its provisions (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). 2006 Dec 13 [cited 2018 Aug 5]. Available from: https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html." id="1">1</a>). The result was theÂ Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, passed by Parliament in 2016 and implemented in 2017 (<a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.

The legislation moves from a charity approach to a rights-based approach and safeguards the human rights of people with disabilities. The number of disabilities listed was increased from seven to 21. The provisions of the said Act require that any person with benchmark disability (who has a minimum of 40% of a specified disability) is entitled, as a matter of right, to avail all the benefits and accommodations enshrined in the Act including 5% reservation in higher education (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reference text comes here!" id="1">2</a>). Accordingly, the Medical Council of India (MCI) informed candidates for post graduate courses belonging to the disability category that persons with any of the 21 disabilities incorporated in the RPwD Act are considered as eligible in 2018 (<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharma JP.

                <p>Armed with a progressive legislation and amendments in the MCI Regulations, candidates with disabilities appeared for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-UG) to seek admission to the medical course under the disability quota. Out of the 110 students selected under the disability quota this year, the Directorate of Medical Education, Mumbai declared eight students ineligible, all of whom have learning disabilities (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reference text comes here!" id="1">5</a>). Similar incidents of candidates with dyslexia, hearing impairment, low vision, dwarfism, upper limb disability, haemophilia being denied admission were reported across the country (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reference text comes here!" id="1">6</a>). These decisions were based on the recent "Guidelines for admission of person with specified disabilities" prepared by an Expanded Committee on Disability constituted under the (MCI) (<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India.

                <h4>What are the new MCI guidelines?</h4>
                <p>Last year, a candidate with thalassemia knocked at the door of the Supreme Court and successfully got admission into the medical course under the disability quota (<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharma JP.

The MCI, earlier this year, communicated to all counselling authorities that all candidates with these 21 benchmark disabilities are eligible for the benefit of the disability quota in the medical course (<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharma JP.

Later, in pursuance of the communication from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), MCI submitted its new guidelines on June 5, 2018 (<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India.

                <p>As per the guidelines, despite having benchmark disabilities, candidates with Specific Learning Disabilities (SpLD), visual impairment, hearing impairment, and autism are considered ineligible for the disability quota in the medical course. There is an upper cap of 60% for non-dominant upper limb disability and spine involvement; and 80% for disabilities arising from haematological and chronic neurological disorders; and lower limb disabilities (Table 1).</p>

                <h4>Why the MCI Guidelines are unfair</h4>
                <p>Six experts were chosen by MCI to frame pan-India guidelines for 21 disabilities. All experts were from Delhi and five of them from a single institute (<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India.

Maharashtra, which was the first state to start providing accommodation to children with dyslexia, and many other states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa and Gujarat) who recognise and have experience with accommodating learning disabilities, were not represented.</p>
                <p>The lone member of the MCI committee responsible for setting guidelines for people with SpLD was a psychiatrist who did not recommend medical admission for applicants with dyslexia stating "lack of objective method/quantification of disability to establish presence and extent of mental illness" (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reference text comes here!" id="1">4</a>; pp 17-18). The expert further raised the concern that there will be foul play by parents to get fake disability certificates for their wards and stated that "demand for SLD and ASD certificate has grown out of proportion"; however, he cited no reference in support of this claim (<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India.

                <p>SpLD refers to a group of conditions, which encompass dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and Attention Deï¬cit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gibbs J, Appleton J, Appleton R.

The Department of Paediatrics, AIIMS, New Delhi, which worked extensively with the National Trust of the Government of India and organised training programs for doctors on the new Autism scale last year was not involved (<a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhatnagar GV.

Thus, the MCI did not adopt an inter-disciplinary approach by involving those specialities that are usually entrusted with the diagnosis and care of individuals with SpLD.</p>

Last year, in class XII (CBSE board) only 840/10,19,360 students across the country were diagnosed as having dyslexia.

Press Release-Senior School Certificate Examination (Class - XII) 2018. Appendix-V. Available from: http://cbse.nic.in/prunit/Press%20Release.htm" id="11">11</a>). A minuscule 0.08 %, in two successive years, cannot justify using the term "overdiagnosis"; nor should it be the basis of the suggestion that this figure represents a "rise in fake disability certificates". Considering quantification is not standardized currently for SpLD, so benchmark disability present or absent should be used as the criteria to tackle the problem of quantification till we develop better tools.

Similarly, there are multiple instances of doctors with disabilities with more than 80% locomotor disability working as faculty and residents in government instituions in the country. Also, the notification from the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment on 'Identification of Posts suitable for persons with disabilities' states that if a post is already held by a person with disability, it shall be deemed to have been identified. There are doctors with hearing impairment currently doing specialisation in clinical branches, yet candidates with visual and hearing impairment were obliged to file cases in the court this year.</p>

                <h4>Why the MCI Guidelines are discriminatory</h4>
                <p>The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) framed guidelines for evaluation and the procedure for certification of various specified disabilities - the guidelines were finalised by the MoHFW and were notified by the Central Government in the Gazette on January 4, 2018 (<a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities. Guidelines for assessment of extent of disability and certification of specified disabilities. Gazette of India (Extra-Ordinary). 2018 Jan 4 [cited 2018 Aug 5]. Available from: http://disabilityaffairs.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/Guidelines%20notification_04_01_2018.pdf" id="13">13</a>). MSJE constituted an expert committee which further created eight sub-committees. It is important to note here that there were separate sub-committees on "developmental disorders" and on "mental illness" in this nodal body. In spite of this, MCI relied on a psychiatrist alone to make sweeping comments on developmental disabilities, suggesting that they discriminate against people with learning disability.</p>
                <p>The MSJE committee had experts from different hospitals, from the Indian Council of Medical Research, and it included Directors of National Institutes working for people with disabilities under the Central Government, and the Director General of Health Services (DGHS). The DGHS is the final authority to decide upon cases where any controversy or doubt arises in the interpretation of the definitions or classifications or evaluation procedures regarding the said guidelines. Yet the DGHS was never consulted by the MCI.</p>
                <p>The MSJE Assessment Guidelines clearly state that for SpLD, the diagnosis will require a team approach involving a paediatrician and a clinical or rehabilitation psychologist. They identified neuropsychology battery by National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences as a diagnostic tool. For disability certification, the guidelines specified that the medical authority should comprise of (<a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities.

                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>(a) The Medical Superintendent/Chief Medical Officer/Civil Surgeon (b) Pediatrician or Pediatric Neurologist (where available) (c) Clinical or Rehabilitation Psychologist (d) Occupational therapist or Special Educator or Teacher trained for assessment of SpLD.</em></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Recognising that SpLD is not a mental disorder, the recommended team does not include a psychiatrist. Yet, the MCI included a psychiatrist and excluded experts who are mandated by the Central Government to do this job. The Assessment Guidelines also clearly mention that no reassessment is required after 18 years of age and that this certificate will be valid lifelong. The basis for this decision is that the coping strategy of dyslexics and their learning patterns are usually established by the time they go to higher education, making reassessment at that stage a wasteful exercise. The MCI's insistence on re-evaluation smacks of discrimination.</p>

                <h4>Why the MCI Guidelines are unlawful</h4>
                <p>The Delhi High Court on July 31, 2018, granted relief to a hearing-impaired candidate (<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Delhi High Court.

The court, however granted her permission upholding the principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunity enshrined in UNCRPD. The court observed that the MCI recommendation has not yet attained finality and is pending consideration before the MoHFW and the amendment, in this behalf, has so far not been carried out in the relevant regulations (<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Delhi High Court.

The MCI guidelines disentitling persons with specified benchmark disabilities are "abhorrent to the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India and to the provisions of the RPwD Act."</p>
                <p>The court stressed that the RPwD Act came into being to give effect to the UNCRPD provisions, to which India is a signatory. "The Preamble to the said Act does not permit for any deviation from the stated objective"; while directing the petitioner to participate in the counselling under the disability quota and the concerned authority to reserve a seat in MBBS course for the current academic session (<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Delhi High Court.

                <p>This is not the first such decision, as much before the enactment of RPwD Act, the apex court in India mentioned the doctrine of "reasonable accommodation" for the first time in a judgment while pulling up the Jammu and Kashmir High Court (<a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Supreme Court of India.

                <p>One of the biggest flaws of both the MCI committee and the MSJE Committee framing Assessment Guidelines is the exclusion of doctors with disabilities on the committees. We, the disabled people, are real-life experts on matters pertaining to disabilities. As I wrote in the <em>Indian Express</em>, policymakers and doctors without the lived experience of having a disability must not assume they know of our abilities or doubt our competencies (<a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh S.

If the ceiling broke it was because of my lived experience as a doctor with disability. Unfortunately, history has repeated itself as candidates with disabilities have been denied medical admission this year by MCI.</p>
                <p>The rights of people with disabilities are protected globally by legislations &ndash; The Americans with Disabilities Act (US), The Equality Act (UK) and The RPwD Act (India). There is literature available to counter the MCI prejudice. The majority of students with disabilities in medical education in the United States have invisible disabilities - ADHD (33.7%), SpLD (21.5%), psychological disability (20%), deafness or being hard of hearing (2.2%) -in addition to visual (3%) and mobility (2%) disability (<a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Meeks LM, Herzer KR.

                <p>Willem Kolff (father of artificial organs & pioneer of heamodialysis) and Helen Taussig (founder of paediatric cardiology) both had dyslexia (<a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh S.

                <p>I feel it is unethical to label candidates with disabilities under benchmark disability and offer no support. The majority of medical institutions in the country are not accessible to people with disabilities. Based on my case before the National Human Rights Commission, MCI amended the Standard Assessment Form, thereby fixing the accountability of barrier-free campus on to the institution by putting this in the Dean's Declaration form (<a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National Human Rights Commission.

Diversity and inclusion are unfortunately still not on the agenda of medical educators in India. One very important role of curriculum designers is to generate products to fulfil the needs of students with a varying range of abilities, learning styles, and preferences. In this sense, the use of media in medical education should help teachers proactively plan for students with diverse characteristics, and institutions should include strategies for creating an inclusive curriculum and instructional methods. This can only be achieved through using universal design <em>for</em> learning.</p>
                <p>Universally-designed presentations and handouts (replacing white backgrounds with pastel colours, using Sans-Serif fonts, avoiding underlining titles, using flowcharts & concept maps) are recommended by doctors with dyslexia as inclusive practices (<a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National Consultation Meeting for developing Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), Guidelines on Neuro-developmental Disorders under the aegis of IAP Childhood Disability Group and the Committee on Child Development and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, C Nair MK, Prasad C, Unni J, Bhattacharya A, Kamath SS, Dalwai S.

This will help colour blind students too. Three UK studies have analysed the impact of dyslexia on performance in different exam formats (<a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shaw SCK, Malik M, Anderson JL. The exam performance of medical students with dyslexia: a review of the literature. MedEdPublish. 2017 Jul 3;6." id="22">22</a>) and they found that 25% extra time allows students with dyslexia to perform as well as other students. It is important to note that no accommodations were provided to candidates with SpLD in the NEET-UG, yet many cracked this tough entrance examination. Section 21(2) of the RPwD Act mandates every establishment to frame an Equal Opportunity Policy and this is where such accommodations must be mentioned and fulfilled in letter and in spirit. Section 21 of the RPwD Act 2016 and Section 10 of the RPwD Rules 2017 mandates appointment of a Grievance Redressal Officer in every establishment to circumvent deviations.</p>
                <p>MCI may please note that denial of reasonable accommodation has been defined as "discrimination" under section 2(h) of the RPwD Act 2016 and therefore any person or establishment contravening the provisions of this Act can be subject to punishment under section 89 and 92. A group of 75 doctors with disabilities have now written to the Health Minister to reject the "discriminatory" MCI guidelines and embrace diversity in medical education by adopting best global practices (<a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Perappadan BS.

The General Medical Council of the UK come up with <em>Gateways to the Profession</em> (2008, updated 2013) which is being revised currently into <em>Welcomed and Valued</em> (2018) which advises medical educators on how students and doctors with disabilities can be provided with an enabling environment (<a class="reference" href="#twentysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="General Medical Council, UK.

Earlier in June, the Association of American Medical Colleges released a report on the lived experiences of learners and physicians with disabilities and how they enrich diversity (<a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Charmatz M. AAMC report provides key insights of medical schools' responsibilities. Disability Compliance for Higher Education. 2018 Jul;23(12):1-3." id="27">27</a>). MCI, as per the needs of the RPwD Act and in consultation with doctors with disabilities, may start diversity and inclusion units in all medical institutions to provide reasonable accommodations.</p>
                <p>One notable gap in the literature is the lack of studies on the emotional impact of studying medicine with disability. In granting learners with disabilities accommodations are we inadvertently doing harm by singling them out and leaving them vulnerable to discrimination? More work is needed in this area especially from medical students and doctors with disabilities, provided that they are not stopped from pursuing medicine.</p>
                <p>Students with diverse learning needs must not be barred from entering the medical profession. They add diversity to our profession and we must be inclusive to their needs. The RPwD Act is a welfare legislation based on UNCRPD - the first human rights treaty in the 21st century with a record number of signatories. It is the duty of everyone to see that the principles of UNCRPD are respected and that the provisions of the RPwD Act are carried out.</p>
