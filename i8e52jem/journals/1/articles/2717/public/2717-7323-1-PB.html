                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>Medical students have to go through an incredibly vast number of voluminous textbooks in their undergraduate years. But most of us learn next to nothing about the intricacies of the social determinants of health and the larger socio-political-cultural spaces we will have to negotiate. Without any exposure to the larger patriarchal, economic and historical systems, which are bound to collide with our textbook learning, we will be highly unprepared to locate our own biomedical skills within the larger context. The objective of this article is to analyse the current level of gender sensitivity in the textbooks being used for undergraduate medical training, and the potential impact that this has on developing attitudes towards a gender and rights-based approach.</p>

                <h4>International commitments to integrate gender into Medicine</h4>
                <p>Gender sensitive medical training aims at rectifying the imbalance and injustice in systems of knowledge that have failed to acknowledge the issues women face as a result of their gendered lives. The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt, in 1994 followed by the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in 1995 identified gender-based inequalities as crucial determinants of health (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Conference on Population and Development. Cairo: UNFPA;1994[cited 2018 Oct 6].

Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, China; 1995[cited 2018 Oct 5]. Available from: http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/beijingdeclaration.html" id="2">2</a>). The 2006 WHO Gender, Women and Health (GWH) meeting report documented examples of international efforts at integrating gender studies across all years of the undergraduate medical curricula. Gender studies was integrated into the curriculum for medical education in the Chulalangkorn medical school in Thailand in 2003&mdash;2004, followed up by a questionnaire-based evaluation of the new gender-integrated programme in 2006. The evaluation showed that most of the respondents had a positive attitude to gender issues, and applied gender concepts in their work and in their personal lives (<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Meeting report of Integrating gender into the curricula for health professionals, 2006. Geneva: WHO;2006 Dec 4-6 [cited 2018 Oct 5]. Available from: http://www.who.int/gender/documents/GWH_curricula_web2.pdf" id="3">3</a>). Other noteworthy attempts at inclusion include: making gender considerations an integral part of topics such as sexuality, sexual and reproductive health (Turkey and China), and intimate partner and family violence (Philippines), using web-based teaching modules, building faculty capacity, promoting and winning institutional support (<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Meeting report of Integrating gender into the curricula for health professionals, 2006. Geneva: WHO;2006 Dec 4-6 [cited 2018 Oct 5]. Available from: http://www.who.int/gender/documents/GWH_curricula_web2.pdf" id="3">3</a>).</p>
                <p>In India, the National Health Policy, 2017, provides for gender sensitive healthcare facilities and promotion of equity, but there is no direction on how it is to be achieved (<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt of India. National Health Policy, 2017. New Delhi: MOHFW:2017 [cited 2018 Oct 6]. Available from: http://cdsco.nic.in/writereaddata/National-Health-Policy.pdf" id="4">4</a>). The policy does not address the need for gender sensitive medical education, nor does it mention sexuality when speaking of reproductive and sexual health. A rights-based perspective, when talking about reproductive and sexual health, and its linkage to health as a fundamental right, is totally absent. This is one of the reasons why medical education in India is lagging behind in gender sensitivity training, and thus in the provision of effective and equitable healthcare services.</p>

                <h4>Objectives of medical training</h4>
                <p>Medical training needs to guide students not only to arrive at a clinical diagnosis and plan the appropriate treatment, but also to imagine healthcare frameworks that can lead to a better quality of life. There are important biological, social and behavioural factors tied to unequal gender relations between people of different gender identities, coupled with social inequality and economic deprivation, affecting the manifestation, epidemiology and pathophysiology of diseases and access to healthcare.</p>
                <p>For example, women who seek healthcare from a gynaecologist may also need support or protection from intimate partner violence, or for ensuring that she can use contraception of her choice without family members controlling her options. It is necessary to remember that these women approaching the public healthcare system are often survivors of socio-economic injustices, making them vulnerable to discriminatory treatment and potential exploitation (<a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Prakash P, George A, Panalal R. Sexism in medicine and women's rights. Indian J Soc Work. 1993 Apr; LIV(2):199-204." id="5">5</a>). Medical textbooks should therefore be able to tackle issues related to gender and sexual inequalities, violence, and culturally defined norms that adversely affect the health of women in society. Textbooks are the cornerstone of the learning process and can shape the approaches and attitudes of readers and learners. Thus, it is important that women's health needs are addressed with sensitivity.</p>

                <h4>Review of literature</h4>
                <p>This paper reviews the latest editions of undergraduate textbooks (edited or written by Indian authors only) of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Forensic Medicine and Preventive and Social Medicine from a gender perspective, with a focus on women's health, social determinants of health, and topics related to gender-based violence, and compares it to the 2005 analysis that appeared in the <em>Economic and Political Weekly</em><sup>1</sup>. The textbooks reviewed are commonly used by teachers and undergraduates as well as postgraduate students across most medical colleges in India. Given below are examples of the language in medical textbooks which reflects the attitude&mdash;or even prejudices&mdash;of the authors, that reinforce patriarchal biases in the minds of students who have never been exposed to other perspectives.</p>
                <h5>Rape</h5>
                <p>For ages, young girls have been taught to be passive and boys to be aggressive. In a male-dominated society, these stereotypes strengthen the assumption that women want to be sexually dominated by men, and that men have a right to ignore consent, demand sexual compliance, and control a woman's body and sexuality.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>The material facts to be considered are the conduct and behaviour [sic] of the victim. It is not rape where a woman initially objects, but subsequently gives her consent to sexual act." </em>(<a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reddy KSN, Murty OP.

                </blockquote>
                <p>The social behaviour of rape victims is often generalised, without recognising that the social realities of women who survive rape are varied, and their reactions will be diverse with varying degrees of fear, embarrassment, guilt and anger. But anything considered inconsistent or <em>bad fit</em> can get interpreted as a false accusation, a mental disorder, or just dismissed (<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ahrens CE. Being silenced: The impact of negative social reactions on the disclosure of rape. Am J Community Psychol. 2006 Dec;38(3-4):263-74." id="7">7</a>). When a woman is seeking medical attention after a sexual assault, healthcare providers often ask hostile and irrelevant questions concerning her clothing, marital status, sexual history, and level of resistance, dwelling on the victim's gender and the sexual aspect of the assault instead of simply acknowledging it as an act of violence (<a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="George A.

Doctors may convey a sense of disbelief causing delay or reluctance in getting medical help and reporting the act (<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ahrens CE.

                <p>The definitions of rape/sexual violence exclude marital rape, and men as victims of sexual violence (<a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reddy KSN, Murty OP. The Essentials of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology; 34th Edition; New Delhi; Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd; 2017." id="6">6</a>); and rape laws are different for married and unmarried minors. Men are not seen as being susceptible to sexual violence. Men being victims of rape is considered incompatible with their masculinity, particularly in societies where men are discouraged from talking about their emotions. Society assumes that a man should be able to protect himself and deal with the consequences of the attack "like a man". Although these findings relate to sexual violence against men committed in time of peace, there is nothing to suggest that it does not also pertain to times of conflict (<a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sivakumaran S. Sexual violence against men in armed conflict, European Journal of International Law. 2007 Apr;18 (2):253-76" id="10">10</a>). Sexual violence is often (wrongly) presented as a proof of individual masculinity and power, especially if a man feels his masculinity is being questioned or challenged. Such situations are not presented in medical textbooks; thus, students often lack the perspective to understand sexual violence against men. Despite section 377 IPC being scrapped, sexual violence against men persists as a taboo topic. Community and service providers often react negatively to the sexual orientation of male victims and the gender of their perpetrators (<a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Leith J.

Eventually, male victims may be very vague in explaining their injuries when they are seeking medical or mental health services. Male victims of sexual violence have reported a lack of services and support, and that legal systems are ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime (<a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sivakumaran S.

                <p>Textbooks make no efforts to clarify that sexual orientation and expressions of gender identity occur naturally and are an essential component of one's identity. Without any scientific basis, homosexuality is being wrongly described as a pathological condition using offensive and discriminatory words like "mental degenerates", harming their dignity, self-worth, right to privacy and protection.</p>
                <h5>Virginity</h5>
                <p>Rape survivors in India continue to be subjected to intrusive tests like the two-finger/virginity test for assessment of sexual violence.<sup>2</sup> These tests are performed under the belief that genitalia habituated to sexual intercourse has a specific appearance. Textbooks do not take into consideration that the vagina is a dynamic muscular canal that varies in size and shape depending on individual, developmental stage, physical position, and various hormonal factors such as sexual arousal and stress. A WHO study by Olson and Garcia-Moreno (<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Olson RM, Garc&iacute;a-Moreno C. Virginity testing: a systematic review. Reprod Health. 2017 May 14;14(1):61." id="14">14</a>) shows that the size of the hymenal opening is an unreliable test for vaginal penetration, as it varies with the method of examination, the position of the examinee, the cooperation and relaxation of the examinee, and the examinee's age, weight, and height. It was also found that most hymenal injuries heal rapidly and leave no evidence of previous trauma. The study indicates that the inspection of the hymen cannot give conclusive evidence of vaginal penetration, or any other sexual history. Further, virginity testing can cause serious physical, long-term psychological effects of self-hatred, loss of self-esteem due to the violation of privacy, and the fear and trauma the examination causes. The prevailing social rationale for testing is that an unmarried female's virginity is indicative of her moral character and social values, bringing in shame and dishonour to families and communities, and a way to separate "pure" from "impure" females (<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Olson RM, Garc&iacute;a-Moreno C. Virginity testing: a systematic review. Reprod Health. 2017 May 14;14(1):61." id="14">14</a>).</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>VIRGINITY: A female is called a virgin (Virgo intacta) if she has never experienced any sexual intercourse.</em> (<a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rao NG.

                </blockquote>
                <p>Virginity, as a concept, exists for men too but without the same social implications or significance. Textbooks are perpetuating this negative gender stereotype without offering a sociological explanation for a patriarchal society's need to control women's sexuality and the stigma around pre-marital sex for women. Virginity is thus a social construct and not a medical fact. Why is it still being taught to medical students when it has no medical relevance? From a human rights perspective, virginity testing is a form of gender discrimination, as well as a violation of fundamental rights, and when carried out without her consent, a form of sexual violence.</p>
                <p>The Forensic Medicine textbook (<a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reddy KSN, Murty OP. The Essentials of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology; 34th Edition; New Delhi; Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd; 2017." id="6">6</a>) in fact has a table explaining the differences between a virgin and "deflorate", which is not just offensive labelling but also factually incorrect and legally of no relevance to rape. The focus should be more on victim and witness testimonies, rather than physical examinations for injuries, because absence of injuries is frequently equated with the absence of assault, denying victims their rights and autonomy (<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Olson RM, Garc&iacute;a-Moreno C.

                <p>This text assumes that the main goal and justification for providing women access to contraceptive methods is population control, rather than facilitating women's control over their own bodies. It does not consider unequal distribution of resources and inadequate public sector spending on health as a barrier to better standards of living, nor does it reflect upon the politics of the globalised world where consumption patterns of the global North are ignored and only birth rates of the global South are in focus. Despite India being a signatory to the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) programme of action (Cairo 1994), which ushered in a paradigm shift from population demographics to individual sexual and reproductive rights and health, access to contraception is being projected as a solution to population growth (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Conference on Population and Development.

                <p>The use of the phrase "family planning" instead of contraception also assumes a heteronormative married couple as the basis of a family. This excludes any discussion around other sexualities and family structures, and fails to apprise medical students of how unequal gender relations put women at risk of unwanted pregnancies and how they affect women's mobility, decision-making and access to contraceptives. For example, students need to be aware of the difficulties that women face in negotiating condom use, such as the fear of violence, accusation of infidelity, and abandonment.</p>

Surely, if the woman should avoid future pregnancies because she has serious heart disease, it makes sense not to do an invasive surgery on her but instead encourage the male partner to undergo a vasectomy?

                <p>Shaw's textbook states without justification that a psychiatric disorder is an indication to undergo sterilisation. Using phrases such as "unfit to bear children" to describe patients suffering from mental illnesses and promoting sterilisation are violations of their reproductive rights, including the right to make decisions regarding sterilisation and contraception.</p>
                <p>Contraception counselling should be given more attention in both textbooks and practice. The woman should be presented with all options and empowered to make a choice. In India, the decision to remove an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) is not always in women's hands, and providers often hesitate to remove IUDs. It would be desirable that textbooks guide students about the rationale for choosing each method and about the right of women to discontinue an unsuitable contraceptive method, irrespective of non-medical reasons such as family/husband/partner opposition. These textbooks need to educate students about areas where the reproductive rights of women are likely to be violated during the provision of contraceptive services, like overt or covert coercion for sterilisation or IUDs, coercion for contraceptives while providing MTP services or caesarean section and so on (<a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Iyengar K.

                <p>With words like "high-risk", "consequences" and "ignore", the focus of the text is on abstinence as contraception for adolescents, further stigmatising consensual sexual activity. It does not talk about the importance of sex and sexuality education in providing young people with honest, age-appropriate information, and the ability, and comfort to manage their sexual health and relationships throughout life in an empowered way. The needs of adolescent patients and the difficulties they face in terms of lack of information about contraception and sexuality, talking to adults, financial barriers, and stigma around pre-marital sex that delays seeking healthcare, should be kept in mind as part of medical training. Doctors should be trained and sensitised to address a woman's contraceptive needs, expectations and concerns, while clearing misperceptions about contraceptive methods in a way that is compatible with the patient's health literacy, regardless of their age or sexual history. Access to and use of emergency contraception should routinely be included and an adolescent patient should at no time be forced to use a method chosen by someone other than herself, including a parent, guardian, partner or healthcare provider.</p>

DC Dutta's Textbook of Obstetrics; 9th Edition; New Delhi; Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd; 2017." id="16">16</a>) does not explain the rationale behind abortion services (such as the lack of access to safe abortion) and the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act in 1971. Apart from mentioning that the husband's consent is not required, there is little information on the implications of this Act for women patients and service providers (<a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Iyengar K. How gender-sensitive are obstetrics and gynaecology textbooks?&quot; Econ Pol Wkly. 2005 Apr 30;40(18):1839-46." id="19">19</a>). Textbooks should include sections on various important provisions related to confidentiality and consent that give women space for informed decision-making, as well as on the interpretations of the Act. Currently, there is no section on pre-abortion counselling and provider-patient communication for abortion. It is important that women with unwanted pregnancies are provided counselling on whether they wish to terminate or continue, and issues related to the procedure such as pain, time taken, cost, choice of procedure etc.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>It is worth emphasizing that in India, when a newly married couple in a stable relationship presents with an unplanned pregnancy and is considering the alternative of MTP, it is worth spending time with them. Counseling them about all aspects of MTP, giving them time to mull over their decision and encouraging them to continue the pregnancy unless there are pressing needs to the contrary. In practice, it has been seen that more than 50% of such couples opt out for continuation of pregnancy and that they have not later regretted their decision, whereas a frivolous decision on the part of the couple often ends up in regret. All patients undergoing MTP should be counseled to accept contraceptive advice in order to avoid future unplanned pregnancies.</em> (<a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Daftary SN, Chakravarti S, Pai MV, Kushtagi P.

                <p>Textbooks encourage doctors to accept the ideal of a heteronormative family, meant for the purpose of reproduction. Healthcare of young, single women is often compromised because their decision to abort is judged as frivolous and textbooks urge doctors to counsel the women to continue the pregnancy. Women seeking abortions, especially in public facilities, or coming in for repeated abortions are pressurised to adopt certain methods of long-term contraception and may even be pressurised to go in for sterilisation (<a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Iyengar K.

These textbooks fail to note that power imbalances faced by women may necessitate terminating unwanted pregnancies and that repeated abortions may be a marker of intimate partner violence. Women, especially from poor and rural areas, face multiple constraints in accessing abortion such as: obtaining approval from the family, not having any free public sector services nearby, not being able to afford the cost of services in the private sector, lack of mobility, issues related to confidentiality and lack of information. This simply does not allow for rights-based access to safe abortion. Textbooks should sensitise medical students about women's lack of decision-making power regarding sex, contraception and pregnancies, and while taking histories, students should also be taught to enquire about the woman's social relations, family, support or lack thereof, history of violence, or other anxieties.</p>

                <p>Gender differences in health and illness are due to biological, psychological, social, cultural and political factors, and they affect how healthcare is provided, organised and accessed. It is critical that doctors are aware of gender norms, values and power relations affecting the provider and the patient, influencing the nature and quality of their interaction. Medical professionals witness rights violations on a daily basis and are key players in advocating for sexual and reproductive health rights. As healthcare providers and leaders, doctors are in a position of privilege from where they can act as agents of change, by creating an environment that is respectful, safe and effective, providing dignified care that is suited to and responsive to their needs as individuals. As research and evidence is critical to changing attitudes in medicine, there is a need to strengthen research on gender differences, critically evaluate new information through a gender lens, demonstrate an understanding of the gendered nature and impact of healthcare systems on populations and individuals receiving healthcare, and adopt best practices that incorporate knowledge of sex and gender differences in health and disease. Even if textbooks don't change easily, critiques should be offered by sensitised medical faculty members during the process of training. Integrating a gender perspective in medical education in a systematic and progressive manner at all levels will result in greater gender awareness among future doctors.</p>
